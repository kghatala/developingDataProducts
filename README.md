## Repository for Johns Hopkins University Developing Data Products course project

Within this repository are the files used in the shiny application that I developed for my course project. See [this repository](https://github.com/kghatala/developingDataProducts-slidify) for a Slidify presentation that briefly explains the purpose of this application and how it works.
