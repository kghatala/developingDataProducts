## Repository for Johns Hopkins University Developing Data Products course project

I took the [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) course, offered on Coursera by Johns Hopkins University, primarily as a way to familiarize myself with the [Shiny web application framework](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) developed by RStudio. Shiny offers an easy-to-use framework for building statistically-based web applications directly within RStudio. The Developing Data Products course also provides a great overview of [slidify](http://slidify.org/), a package that provides a straightforward approach for creating web-based presentations in RMarkdown. For examples of what you can do in slidify, visit their webpage or (for a very basic example) see my repository that is linked below. Other topics covered in the course included RCharts (a way to produce interactive JavaScript visualizations without needing to learn D3) and googleVis (a way to create HTML graphics in R that access and call upon Google Charts). I would highly recommend it if you're interested in learning about the diversity of tools now available in RStudio.

Within this repository are the files used in the Shiny application that I developed for my course project. See [this repository](https://github.com/kghatala/developingDataProducts-slidify) for a Slidify presentation that briefly explains the purpose of this application and how it works.
